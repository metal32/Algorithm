## Validation is a process of uncovering problems and increase our confidence. <<- It tells program is not working

## Debugging is a process of ascertaining why the program is not working.<<- It tells why program is not working.
   ## Performance Debugging <<- Trying to run the program fast and fast.

""" Testing and Debugging are not similar """

## When we test we compare input, output pair to a specification.
## While when we debug, we study the events that lead to an error.

""" Unit Testing """
## Asses functions and classes in a program

""" Integration Testing """
## It asseses the ooverall program

### Now for testing a function we can't do exhaustive testing, so we use something that is known as Test suite which is not very large but also 
### small enough to provide us with the required confidence.

"""Debugging tips"""
## Print statement
## Reading your own code
## Be systematic : Reduce search space
## Instead of asking why the program didn't produce the desired result ASK ANOTHER QUESTION How could it have produced this result?
